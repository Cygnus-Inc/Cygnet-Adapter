    A clusterState should sync connected adapters, broadcast removal, failure checks.
    A cluster parent record should be identified by an adapter which inheritely contains its containers informations and state.

2 - Describe each node record
3 - Refactor clusterState and and EtcdCluster to inherit twisted client protocol to be ran with the HybridRunner.
